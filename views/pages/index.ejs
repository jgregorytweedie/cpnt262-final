                        <h1> Rose </h1>
                        <p> The Rock Rose (Pavonia lasiopetala), also known as the Rose Mallow, is a great perennial for
                            the
                            California garden because of its drought tolerance and long flower bloom time.It will grow
                            between
                            3-6 feet tall and wide and prefers well-drained rocky soils. Herbaceous stems rise from a
                            woody base
                            with pink hibiscus-like flowers and velvety, scalloped leaves. The Rock Rose is an excellent
                            choice
                            for your landscape because it is able to survive the summer heat, it grows easily, and has
                            beautiful
                            flowers that attract hummingbirds and butterfliesYarrow, (Achillea sp.), is found all
                            throughout
                            North America and is an american garden classic.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h1> Rose </h1>
                        <p> It grows to 3 feet tall with clustered flower heads at the top of the upwards shooting
                            stems. The
                            leaves are pinnately lobed and divided into smaller leaflets, giving them a delicate,
                            fern-like,
                            lacy appearance.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h1> Rose </h1>
                        <p> Different varieties come in variable heights and flower colors. Yarrow blooms from late
                            April to
                            early July in the southern part of the country, and prefers sun to part-shade. It has a high
                            drought
                            tolerance but likes to be watered every once and a while. This great little plant has been
                            used
                            ornamentally and medicinally for years and will continue to be a staple in the California
                            garden</p>
