                        <p> Based out of Calgary, and ever since 1904, Green's shoes has been the top competitor when it comes to handcrafted, Canadian made shoes. </p>

                        <h1> Our Mission </h1>
                        <p> We noticed that huge corporations will go about creating decent footwear with borderline unethical practices, Green's Shoes Warehouse recognizes that ethically made shoes are what should always come first. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h1> Affordable, Great quality. </h1>
                        <p> Why spend so much money on a shoe that will last you only 3 months? Why are the most durable shoes always the ones that look the ugliest? Here at Green's Shoe Warehouse, we recognize that dilemma, and so we prioritize making the most durable and fashionable shoes.</p>
